# [Introduction to  RStudio](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/01-rstudio-intro/index.html) and [Project management](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/02-project-intro/index.html) (35 min)

## Why R?

- It is a **free** and **open-source** programming language/software! 
- It was created by statisticians for **statistics** 
- It's script-based, hence great for **reproducibility** 

## Why RStudio?

- RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE)
- It provides a (much prettier) interface for the R software
- R is integrated into RStudio, so you never actually have to open R 

## Default layout

- Entire Left / Bottom Left : **R console** (what R would look and be like without RStudio)
- Top right: **Environment/History** (look here to see what you have done)
- Bottom Right: Files/Plots/Packages/Help/Viewer (see the contents of the project/working directory)

- Top left: Once you open files, such as R scripts, an editor panel will also open in the top left.

## Interacting with R

### Two main ways to interact with R

+ Test and play within the interactive R console 
    + Pros: immediate results
    + Cons: work lost once we close RStudio
+ Start writing in an .R file
    + File still will be executed in the console
    + Pros: complete record of what you did!
    - Cons?

### Running the code
+ In the console: `Enter`
+ In the script:
   + `Ctrl` + `Enter` 
   + `Run` button on right left - current line or selection

### Escaping 
The console shows it's ready to get new commands with `>` sign. It will show `+` sign if it still requires input for the command to be executed. 

Sometimes you don't know what is missing/ you change your mind and want to run something else, or your code is running much too long and you just want it to stop. The way to do it is to hit `Esc`.

## Project managament 
R Studio gives a functionality of creating projects: self-contained working space (i.e. working directory), to which R will refer to, when looking for and saving files.

We’re going to create a new project in RStudio:

+ `File` 
+ `New Project` 
+ `Empty project` 
+ browse for directory where you want to keep it 
+ type **r-geospatial** as the name of the project 
+`Create project`

### Tips for project organisation
+ Raw data is read only
+ Cleaned data as read only
+ Generated output is disposable
+ Related data together (Some GIS file formats are really 3-6 files that need to be kept together and have the same name, e.g. shapefiles)
+ Keep consistent naming scheme
+ Name all files to reflect their content or function
+ Stage your scripts: Creating separate R scripts or Rmarkdown documents for different stages of a project

### Organising project/working directory

![](assets/img/rstudio_project_files.jpeg)
 
*Should I create all of them or only /data ?*
 

### Download files 

#### Part 1: 
```{r download-files}
download.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/r-intro-geospatial/master/_episodes_rmd/data/nordic-data.csv', 'data/nordic-data.csv', mode = 'wb')

download.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/r-intro-geospatial/master/_episodes_rmd/data/nordic-data-2.csv', 'data/nordic-data-2.csv', mode = 'wb')

download.file('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datacarpentry/r-intro-geospatial/master/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder_data.csv', 'data/gapminder_data.csv', mode = 'wb')

```

#### Part 2: 
+ Download zip file by clicking on [this link](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/articles/2009586/versions/10)
+ Move the downloaded zip file to the data directory.
+ Once the data have been moved, unzip all files.

## Use R as a calculator

*Should I go through order of operations?*
*Should I go through scientific notation?*

```{r calculator}
1+100

12/7

3*5

```
## Comparing things 

```{r comparison}
1 == 1 # 1 equal to 1

1 != 2 # 1 not equal to 2

1 < 2 # 1 lower than 2

1 <= 1 # 1 lower than or equal to 1

1 > 0 # 1 greater than 0

1 >= -9 # 1 greater than or equal to -9

```

*If you want to test 'near equality' (small differences), use `all.equal()`.

## Variables and assignment

We can store values in variables using the assignment operator `<-`, like this:

```{r asignment-operator}
x <- 1/40
```

Notice that assignment does not print a value. Instead, we stored it for later in something called a variable. x now contains the value 0.025:
```{r asignment-operator2}
x
```

Look for the Environment tab in one of the panes of RStudio, and you will see that x and its value have appeared. 

Our variable x can be used in place of a number in any calculation that expects a number:
```{r use-variable}
sqrt(x)
```

Variables can be also ressigned:
```{r reassign}
x <- 100
```

You can use the 'old' value when reassigning the value
```{r reassign2}
x <- x + 1 #notice how RStudio updates its description of x on the top right tab
y <- x * 2
```

## Challanges 

### Challenge 1 (5 min)

What will be the value of each variable after each statement in the following program?

```{r ex1}
mass <- 47.5
age <- 122
mass <- mass * 2.3
age <- age - 20

```

## Challenge 2
Compare mass to age. Is mass larger than age?
```{r ex2}
mass > age
```


# [Data Structures](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/03-data-structures-part1/index.html) (40+15 min)

## Data types 
There are 6 main types: `numeric`, `integer`, `complex`, `logical`, `character`, and `factor`.
We will skip explanation of the `complex` data type for now. 

```{r data-types}
class(3.14)

class(1) # Although there are no decimal points, R still treats 1 as numeric/double/float
class(1L) # The L suffix forces the number to be an integer, since by default R uses float numbers
class('1')

class(TRUE)

class('banana')

class(factor('banana'))

```

## Vectors 

Vectors are arrays of values of a same data type. You can create vector with a `c()` function. 

```{r vectors}

numeric_vector <- c(2, 6, 3)
numeric_vector

character_vector <- c('banana', 'apple', 'orange')
character_vector

logical_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
logical_vector

```

## Challenge 3 ( taken from [intro to R for social sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/01-intro-to-r/index.html#exercise-3))
What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to check the data type of your objects)
```{r ex3}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")

```

### Type coersion

This is something called type coercion, and it is the source of many surprises and the reason why we need to be aware of the basic data types and how R will interpret them. When R encounters a mix of types (here numeric and character) to be combined into a single vector, it will force them all to be the same type. 

The coercion rules go: `logical -> integer -> numeric -> character`.
You can try to force coercion against this flow using the `as.` functions:

```{r as-functions}
numeric_vector <- c(2, 6, 3)
numeric_vector

numeric_to_character <- as.character(numeric_vector)
numeric_to_character

back_to_numeric <- as.numeric(numeric_to_character)
back_to_numeric

```

### Combining vectors 

The combine function, c(), will also append things to an existing vector:

```{r combine-vectors}

ab_vector <- c('a', 'b')
ab_vector

abcd_vector <- c(ab_vector, 'DC')
abcd_vector

```

You can also make series of numbers:

```{r num-series}
my_series <- 1:10
my_series
```

## Factors 

Another important data structure is called a factor. Factors look like character data, but are used to represent categorical information. For example, let’s make a vector of strings labeling Nordic countries for all the countries in our study:

## Reading data

`read.csv()` is a function used to read coma separated data files (`.csv` format). There are other functions for files separated with other delimiters. 

```{r reading-data}
nordic <- read.csv("data/nordic-data.csv")


```
