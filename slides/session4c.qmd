## How can I crop raster objects to vector objects, and extract the summary of raster pixels?

Objectives:

- Crop a raster to the extent of a vector layer.
- Extract values from a raster that correspond to a vector file overlay.

Keypoints:

- Use the `crop()` function to crop a raster object.
- Use the `extract()` function to extract pixels from a raster object that fall within a particular extent boundary.
- Use the `extent()` function to define an extent.


## Introduction

We often work with spatial layers that have different spatial extents. The spatial extent of a shapefile or R spatial object represents the geographic “edge” or location that is the furthest north, south east and west. Thus is represents the overall geographic coverage of the spatial object.

## Introduction

Frequent use cases of cropping a raster file include 

- reducing file size 
- creating maps. 

Sometimes we have a raster file that is much larger than our study area or area of interest. It is often more efficient to crop the raster to the extent of our study area to reduce file sizes as we process our data. 

Cropping a raster can also be useful when creating pretty maps so that the raster layer matches the extent of the desired vector layers.


## Import the raster 

```{r}
#| eval: false
DSM_TUD <- raster(here("data","tud-dsm.tif"))
DTM_TUD <- raster(here("data","tud-dtm.tif"))
CHM_TUD <- DSM_TUD - DTM_TUD

CHM_TUD_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_TUD, xy = TRUE)

oai_boundary_tudlib <- st_as_sfc(st_bbox(raster(here("data","tudlib-rgb.tif"))))
```


## Crop a Raster Using Vector Extent

We can use the `crop()` function to crop a raster to the extent of another spatial object. To do this, we need to specify the raster to be cropped and the spatial object that will be used to crop the raster. R will use the extent of the spatial object as the cropping boundary.

To illustrate this, we will crop the Canopy Height Model (CHM) to only include the **area of interest (AOI)**. Let’s start by plotting the full extent of the CHM data and overlay where the AOI falls within it. The boundaries of the AOI will be colored blue, and we use `fill = NA` to make the area transparent.



```{r from-ep2}
#| eval: false

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = CHM_TUD_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) +
  geom_sf(data = oai_boundary_tudlib, color = "blue", fill = NA) +
  coord_sf()

```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](fig/rmd-04c-from-ep2-1.png)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Now that we have visualized the area of the CHM we want to subset, we can perform the cropping operation. We are going to use the `crop()` function from the `raster` package to create a new object with only the portion of the CHM data that falls within the boundaries of the AOI.


```{r}
#| eval: false
CHM_TUD_Cropped <- crop(
  x = CHM_TUD,
  y = st_as_sf(oai_boundary_tudlib)
  )
```

## Crop a Raster Using Vector Extent

Now we can plot:
- the cropped CHM data 
- a boundary box showing the full CHM extent. 

However, remember, since this is raster data, we need to convert to a data frame in order to plot using ggplot. 


## Crop a Raster Using Vector Extent

To get the boundary box from CHM, the `st_bbox()` will extract the 4 corners of the rectangle that encompass all the features contained in this object. The `st_as_sfc()` converts these 4 coordinates into a polygon that we can plot:


```{r}
#| eval: false
CHM_TUD_Cropped_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_TUD_Cropped, xy = TRUE)


ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = st_as_sfc(st_bbox(CHM_TUD)), fill = "green",
          color = "green", alpha = .2) +  
  geom_raster(data = CHM_TUD_Cropped_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
  coord_sf()
```

::: {.column width="50%"}
The plot shows that the full CHM extent (plotted in green) is much larger than the resulting cropped raster. Our new cropped CHM now has the same extent as the aoi_boundary_HARV object that was used as a crop extent (blue border below).

    colors = terrain.colors(10)) +

```

This plot shows that the full CHM extent (plotted in green) is much larger than the resulting cropped raster.

## Crop a Raster Using Vector Extent

We can look at the extent of all of our other objects for this field site.

The original:
```{r}
#| eval: false
st_bbox(CHM_TUD)
```

The cropped one:
```{r}
#| eval: false
st_bbox(CHM_TUD_Cropped)
```

The area of interest:
```{r}
#| eval: false
st_bbox(oai_boundary_tudlib)
```

Leisure locations:

```{r}
#| eval: false
leisure_locations_selection <- st_read(here("data", "delft-leisure.shp")) %>% 
  filter(leisure %in% c("playground", "picnic_table"))

st_bbox(leisure_locations_selection)
```

Our plot location extent is not the largest but is larger than the AOI Boundary. It would be nice to see our vegetation plot locations plotted on top of the Canopy Height Model information.

## Challenge

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10)
```


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Crop the Canopy Height Model to the extent of the study plot locations.
- Plot the vegetation plot location points on top of the Canopy Height Model.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](fig/rmd-04c-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)
:::

:::: 


## Solution


```{r}
#| eval: false
CHM_plots_TUDcrop <- crop(x = CHM_TUD, y = leisure_locations_selection)

CHM_plots_TUDcrop_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_plots_TUDcrop, xy = TRUE)

ggplot() + 
  geom_raster(data = CHM_plots_TUDcrop_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
  geom_sf(data = leisure_locations_selection) + 
  coord_sf()
```

In this plot, all the vegetation plot locations (black dots) appear on the Canopy Height Model raster layer except for one. One is situated on the blank space to the left of the map. Why?

## Cropping vector layers

The `crop()` function will make a raster extent smaller, it will not expand the extent in areas where there are no data. Thus, the extent of our vegetation plot layer will still extend further west than the extent of our (cropped) raster data (dark green).

## Define an extent

So far, we have used a shapefile to crop the extent of a raster dataset. 

Alternatively, we can also the `extent()` function to define an extent to be used as a cropping boundary. This creates a new object of class extent. 

Here we will provide the `extent()` function our **xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax** (in that order).

```{r}
#| eval: false
# extent(CHM_TUD_Cropped_df)
new_extent <- extent(85272.25, 85661.25, 446295.2, 446693.8)
class(new_extent)
```

**TIP: The extent can be created from a numeric vector (as shown above), a matrix, or a list. For more details see the `extent()` function help file (`?raster::extent`).**

## Define an extent

Once we have defined our new extent, we can use the crop() function to crop our raster to this extent object.

```{r}
#| eval: false
CHM_TUD_manual_cropped <- crop(x = CHM_TUD, y = new_extent)

```

To plot this data using `ggplot()` we need to convert it to a dataframe.

```{r}
#| eval: false
CHM_TUD_manual_cropped_df <- as.data.frame(CHM_TUD_manual_cropped, xy = TRUE)

```

## Define an extent

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Now we can plot this cropped data. We will show the AOI boundary on the same plot for scale.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = oai_boundary_tudlib, color = "blue", fill = NA) +
  geom_raster(data = CHM_TUD_manual_cropped_df,
              aes(x = x, y = y, fill = layer)) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(name = "Canopy Height", colors = terrain.colors(10)) + 
  coord_sf()

```

## Extract Raster Pixels Values Using Vector Polygons

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Often we want to extract values from a raster layer for particular locations - for example, plot locations that we are sampling on the ground. 

We can extract all pixel values within 20m of our x,y point of interest. These can then be summarized into some value of interest (e.g. mean, maximum, total).

## Extract Raster Pixels Values Using Vector Polygons

To do this in R, we use the `extract()` function. The `extract()` function requires:

- The raster that we wish to extract values from,
- The vector layer containing the polygons that we wish to use as a boundary or boundaries.

We can tell it to store the output values in a data frame using `df = TRUE`. (This is optional, the default is to return a list, NOT a data frame.)

We will begin by extracting all canopy height pixel values located within our `aoi_boundary_HARV` polygon which surrounds the tower located at the NEON Harvard Forest field site.

```{r}
#| eval: false
tree_height <- extract(x = CHM_TUD, 
                       y = st_as_sf(oai_boundary_tudlib),
                       df = TRUE)

str(tree_height)
```

When we use the `extract()` function, R extracts the value for each pixel located within the boundary of the polygon being used to perform the extraction - in this case the `aoi_boundary_HARV` object (a single polygon). Here, the function extracted values from 621,642 pixels.



## Extract Raster Pixels Values Using Vector Polygons


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


We can create a histogram of tree height values within the boundary to better understand the structure or height distribution of trees at our site. We will use the column `layer` from our data frame as our x values, as this column represents the tree heights for each pixel.

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(data = tree_height, aes(x = layer)) +
  ggtitle("Histogram of CHM Height Values (m)") +
  xlab("Tree Height") + 
  ylab("Frequency of Pixels")
```


We can also use the `summary()` function to view descriptive statistics including min, max, and mean height values. These values help us better understand vegetation at our field site.

```{r}
#| eval: false
summary(tree_height$layer)
```

## Summarize Extracted Raster Values

We often want to extract summary values from a raster.

We can tell R the type of summary statistic we are interested in using the `fun = argument`. 

Let’s extract a mean height value for our AOI. 
Because we are extracting only a single number, we will not use the `df = TRUE` argument.

```{r}
#| eval: false
mean_tree_height_AOI <- extract(
  x = CHM_TUD, 
  y = st_as_sf(oai_boundary_tudlib), 
  fun = mean)

head(mean_tree_height_AOI)
```

It appears that the mean height value, extracted from our LiDAR data derived canopy height model is 4.3 meters.



## Extract Data using x,y Locations


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}


We can also extract pixel values from a raster by defining a buffer or area surrounding individual point locations using the `extract()` function. 

To do this we define the summary argument (`fun = mean`) and the buffer distance (`buffer = 20`) which represents the radius of a circular region around each point. 

By default, the units of the buffer are the same units as the data’s CRS. All pixels that are touched by the buffer region are included in the extract.

## Extract Data using x,y Locations

Let’s put this into practice by figuring out the mean tree height in the 20m around the tower location (`point_HARV`). Because we are extracting only a single number, we will not use the `df = TRUE` argument.

```{r}
#| eval: false
point_Delft <- st_read(here("data", "delft-leisure.shp"))

mean_tree_height_tower <- extract(x = CHM_TUD,
                                  y = point_Delft,
                                  buffer = 20,
                                  fun = mean)

head(mean_tree_height_tower)
```




## Challenge: Extract Raster Height Values For Plot Locations

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| cache: false
countdown::countdown(minutes = 10)
```


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Use the plot locations object (`plot_locations_sp_HARV`) to extract an average tree height for the area within 20m of each vegetation plot location in the study area. Because there are multiple plot locations, there will be multiple averages returned, so the `df = TRUE` argument should be used.
- Create a plot showing the mean tree height of each area.

mean_tree_height_plots_TUD <- extract(x = CHM_TUD,
                                       y = leisure_locations_selection,
                                       buffer = 20,
                                       fun = mean,
                                       df = TRUE)

# view data
head(mean_tree_height_plots_TUD)
```

Visualisation of the results: 

```{r}

  geom_col() + 
  ggtitle("Mean Tree Height at each Plot") + 
  xlab("Plot ID") + 
  ylab("Tree Height (m)")
```


## Summary and keypoints

We have seen how to crop a raster to the extent of a vector layer and how to extract values from a raster that correspond to a vector file overlay.

In short:

- Use the `crop()` function to crop a raster object.
- Use the `extract()` function to extract pixels from a raster object that fall within a particular extent boundary.
- Use the `extent()` function to define an extent.
